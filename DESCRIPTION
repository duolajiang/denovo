Description: An approach to de novo discovery of effect modification followed by confirmatory hypothesis testing. Based on sample splitting method, the first training sample is used for finding a potential effect modification structure, and the second test sample is used for confirming evidence of effect modification. Furthermore, a sensitivitiy analysis is conducted by using the test sample to investigate of the effect due to unmeasured confounders on the conclusion under no unmeasured confounder assumption.
